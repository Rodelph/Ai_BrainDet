To be able to run this project you should have :
 - tensorflow
 - tensorflow-gpu
 - scikit-image
 - scikit-learn
 - Pillow
 - Flask
 - h5py
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 
For my setup i used :

Library         | Version
-------------   | -------------
Tensorflow      | 2.5.1
Tensorflow-gpu  | 2.5.1
scikit-image    | 0.18.3
scikit-learn    | 1.0
Pillow          | 7.0.0
Flask           | 2.0.1
h5py            | 3.1.0
numpy           | 1.19.2
matplotlib      | 3.4.3

You also need CUDA, and CUDNN on your computer to be able to run the program. My version is 11.2 for cuda and 8.0.4 for cudnn.
 
 Feel free to test the project by typing :
